# Nupuram Malayalam Typeface

A Malayalam typeface, inspired from the early Malayalam movie titles designs. The curves are fluid, bold and expressive.

Taking full advantage of variable font technology, Nupuram offers an unprecedented level of flexibility, all from a single font file. Nupuram has 4 variable axes: `Weight`, `Width`, `Slant` and `Softness`.

As a variable font, Nupuram gives you fine-grained control over each one of its styles. However, it also comes with 64 predefined styles that are easy to access through your font menu. Called *named instances¹*, these work just like regular static fonts do.

¹ *Named instance*: a predetermined location in the designspace of a variable font, similar to the "static instances" that are familiar in traditional digital fonts.

The Variable font capability makes Nupuram stylistically flexible and warmly energetic.
